Key Changes (UPDATE)
1. Finding Storage Nodes:
    Added a lookupStorageNodes function that uses the discovery service to find available storage nodes for storing shards.

2. StoreData Upgrade:
    Now compresses, encrypts, and shards data as before
    Instead of storing locally, it distributes shards to storage nodes via HTTP requests
    Records the node URLs in the metadata for future retrieval

3. RetrieveData Upgrade:
    Retrieves shards from storage nodes using HTTP requests based on metadata
    Handles node failures gracefully (as long as we have enough shards)
    Reconstructs, decrypts, and decompresses the data as before


UPDATE CHANGES (NEXT)
1. Error Handling and Retries:
    Add retry logic for failures when sending/retrieving shards
    Add timeout handling to prevent long waits when nodes are slow

2. Security:
    Implement proper mTLS for all HTTP communications
    Add authentication for storage node access

3. Load Balancing:
    Improve the storage node selection algorithm beyond simple round-robin
